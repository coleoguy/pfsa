trees are from Upham, N.S., Esselstyn, J.A. and Jetz, W., 2019. Inferring the mammal tree: Species-level sets of phylogenies for questions in ecology, evolution, and conservation. PLoS Biology, 17(12).
we are using the node dated trees as the authors suggest these have dates more consistent with existing knowledge and we only are using species for which we have DNA data availalble.
